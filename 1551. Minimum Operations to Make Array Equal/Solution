# Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal

## Intuition

The target is to make each element equal in minimum operations, so we choose the target close to all. The target is given by:

$$
\text{target} = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i + 1)}{n}
$$

We can expand this as follows:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i + 1) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2i + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 1
$$

This can be further simplified:

$$
= 2\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 1
$$

Which leads to:

$$
= 2 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + (n-1 + 1) = (n-1)n + n = n^2
$$

Now, the average is:

$$
\frac{n^2}{n} = n
$$

Thus, the target is \( n \).

## S

The total change required can be calculated as:

$$
S = \sum_{i=0}^{2n-1} (2i + 1 - n) + \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} (n - 2i - 1)
$$

Breaking it down:

1. **For \( S_1 \)**:

   $$
   S_1 = \sum_{i=0}^{2n-1} (2i + 1 - n)
   $$

   Which expands to:

   $$
   S_1 = \sum_{i=0}^{2n-1} (2i + 1) - \sum_{i=0}^{2n-1} n
   $$

   This results in:

   $$
   S_1 = 4(n-1)(n+1) + 2n + 1 - n(2n - 1)
   $$

   Finally:

   $$
   S_1 = 4(n-1)(n+1) + 2(n + 1) - n(2n - 1) = -n + 1
   $$

2. **For \( S_2 \)**:

   $$
   S_2 = \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} (n-1)(n - 2i - 1)
   $$

   Expanding it gives:

   $$
   S_2 = (n-1)(n-1) - 2(n-1)(n-2)
   $$

   Which results in:

   $$
   S_2 = 2(n-1)(n+1) - 2(2(n-1)n - 2(2n-1 - 1)(2n-1))
   $$

Finally, the total operations needed:

$$
S = S_1 + S_2 = (−n + 1) + 2(n^2 + 2n − 3)
$$

Combining gives:

$$
S = 2n^2 - 1
$$

Thus, the final answer is:

$$
4n^2 - 1
$$
